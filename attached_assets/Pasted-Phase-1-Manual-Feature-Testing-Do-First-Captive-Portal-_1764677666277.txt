Phase 1: Manual Feature Testing (Do First)
Captive Portal (Public WiFi Login)
 Visit the home page / - verify glassmorphic design loads
 Select a WiFi plan from dropdown
 Enter a phone number and initiate M-Pesa payment
 Confirm STK Push simulation triggers and shows "Pending"
 Verify transaction completes and user is created
Admin Dashboard
 Navigate to /dashboard - verify stats cards load
 Check "Expiring Soon" widget shows correct data
 View recent transactions list
 Test sidebar navigation to all pages
WiFi Users Page
 Create a new WiFi user manually
 Edit user details (username, plan, expiry)
 Test Suspend/Activate/Recharge actions
 Delete a user
Plans Management
 Create a new plan with speed/duration/price
 Edit an existing plan
 Delete a plan (verify it's removed)
Hotspots Management
 Add a new hotspot/NAS device
 Edit hotspot details (IP, secret)
 Test connection button (stub response)
 View active sessions (stub data)
Support Tickets
 Create a new ticket
 Update ticket status/priority
 Close ticket with resolution
Walled Garden
 Add a new allowed domain
 Remove a domain
Settings
 Update tenant business name
 Save and verify changes persist

Phase 2: Payment Flow Testing
Happy Path: Phone → STK Push → Payment Worker polls → Transaction marked "Completed" → WiFi User created automatically
Retry Logic: Check job queue at /api/jobs/pending - verify failed jobs retry with exponential backoff
Edge Cases:
Invalid phone number format
No plan selected
Duplicate payment attempts

Phase 3: API Testing (Browser DevTools)
Open browser DevTools → Network tab and verify these endpoints return data:
GET /api/dashboard/stats
GET /api/plans
GET /api/hotspots
GET /api/wifi-users
GET /api/transactions
GET /api/tickets
GET /api/walled-gardens
GET /api/reports/financial
GET /api/reports/reconciliation
GET /api/jobs/pending

Phase 4: Mobile & Responsiveness
 Test captive portal on mobile viewport (375px width)
 Test dashboard on tablet (768px)
 Verify glassmorphism effects render correctly
 Check touch interactions work

Production Readiness Checklist
 M-Pesa API credentials configured (when ready)
 Africa's Talking SMS credentials set
 MikroTik router IP/credentials per hotspot
 Database backups configured
 Error logging/monitoring in place

Would you like me to create automated test scripts, or would you prefer to start with manual testing first?
